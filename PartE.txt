1. What is Fragment?
Fragment is a part of the user interface, it can include views, viewgroups, widgets, buttons, etc.
It likes a modular UI component, and can be used in one or several FragmentAcivity.
It has own lifecycle and receives which related to the activity state which declared it.

2. When two XML layout files have almost identical code and expected to change something they both have, use Fragments and do the following things:
(1) Defined a Fragmentâ€™s layout in a xml file, eg: res/layout/fragment_logos.xml
(2) Put the Fragment into activity layout files through:
    a. declaring the fragment_logos with <fragment> tag;
    b. or add the fragment_logos into an existing ViewgGoup in activity.
(3) Now the UI collection in fragment_logos can be displayed in both the portrait layout and land layout files.
(4) If the logo attributes are expected to change, developer can just modify the fragment_logos.xml file,
    then the logo in two layout activity files will be change together.
